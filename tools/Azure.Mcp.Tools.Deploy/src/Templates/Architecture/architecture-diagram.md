Please write this into .azure/architecture.copilotmd WITHOUT additional explanations on the deployment. Explain only the architecture and data flow.
Make changes if these do not fulfill requirements (do not use </br> in strings when generating the diagram):
 ```mermaid\n{{chart}}\n```.
Ask user if the topology is expected, if not, you should directly update the generated diagram with the user's updated instructions.
