Mandatory rules for deployment. You must implement every rule exactly as stated, with no exceptions or omissions, even if it is not a common pattern or seems redundant. Do not use your own judgment to simplify, skip, or modify any rule. If a rule is present, it must be enforced in the code, regardless of context. Adjust {{IacType}} files to align with these rules.
