Call get_errors every time you make code changes, otherwise your deployment will fail. You must follow ALL of the previously mentioned rules. DO NOT IGNORE ANY RULES. Call this tool again if need to get the rules again. Show the user a report line-by-line of each rule that was applied. Only skip a rule if there is no corresponding resource (e.g. no function app). Do not stop at error-free code, you must apply all the rules.
